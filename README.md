# imageSlider

  I wrote this code in a way that everyone can use it easily
  just put the above js script http://austinesamuelcodes.000webhostapp.com/codes/main.js on your on HTML file
  then call the imageSlider function any way in you code
  with your image src In array format as parameter
  for example check bellow

  const myImages=[//list of images
  {src:"https://i.imgur.com/uKlntMI.jpg"},
  {src:"https://i.imgur.com/Tjn5WCY.jpg"},
  {src:"https://i.imgur.com/U2UbGBr.jpg"}, //image urls
  {src:"https://i.imgur.com/mfdDZAZ.jpg"},
  {src:"https://i.imgur.com/PiWc1hU.jpg"}//you put as many as you want
  ]
  imageSlider(myImages);//call this anyway In your code it will work
